## How to use this branch

## Why use Containers with GitHub Action?
Using containers with GitHub Actions offers several advantages. Containers provide a way to define a fully controlled and predefined environment for running your code or performing tasks. With containers, you have the flexibility to define the installed software, configuration, and setup steps that best suit your needs. This allows you to create a consistent and reproducible environment that can be easily shared and reused across different workflows. Containers also offer isolation, ensuring that your code runs consistently regardless of the underlying runner machine. By leveraging containers in GitHub Actions, you gain full control over your development and deployment environment, enabling you to create consistent, portable, and efficient workflows.
